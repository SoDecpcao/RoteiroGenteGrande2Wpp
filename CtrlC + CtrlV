Querido.
Hum?
Vá até a janela agora
e abra-o o máximo que puder.
Por favor, deixe-me dormir.
Penso que a sua
mamãe está aqui do México,
e ela precisa ir embora.
Abra a janela agora.
Por que você não
abra, seu preguiçoso...
Alguem AJUDE!
Feche sua boca!
Sem chance. Posso montá-lo?
Um cervo!
OK.
Papai,
Deixei a porta da frente aberta
caso algum animal
queria entrar.
Você fez, hein?
E um fez.
Sim.
Sim, um maluco.
Oh, não, você fez uma coisa legal,
querido.
Greg, vou precisar de um taco!
Papai, não!
Não, não, eu não estou
vai acertar o cervo.
Eu só vou massagear o dele
cabeça um pouco com isso.
Ok, vamos, vamos.
Ele está bem aqui.
Ele está comendo a comida do Bowser.
Shh.
Ok, ele sabe que estamos aqui agora.
Ficar. Ficar.
O que ele está olhando?
Mova sua boneca em minha direção.
E de volta para você.
Em minha direção.
De volta para você.
Três vezes, rápido.
Dê-me essa coisa.
Sr.
Não, não se preocupe.
Me dê isto.
Prossiga. Tudo bem.
Tudo bem.
Coloque na minha mão.
Roxanne, leve-os para lá.
Lá.
Ei cara.
Você gosta desse cara?
Huh?
Você quer brincar com ele?
Tudo bem vamos lá
brincar na outra sala.
Vamos. Vamos lá, cara.
Caminhe lentamente comigo.
Eu disse lentamente.
Não.
Ah! Ah!
Saia do caminho!
Oh meu Deus!
Problema resolvido.
Senhor Gigglesworth!
Papai, ele está matando ele!
Um novo problema começa.
Desculpe.
Esse é o seu sutiã, Sra. Feder?
Fácil.
Ai credo.
É legal.
Obrigado, tudo bem.
Legal, sim.
Sim, vamos lá.
28?
Sim.
Está certo de novo,
espertinho.
Oi pai.
Ei, Feijão,
trabalhando na matemática, né?
Sim.
Mamãe disse que se eu conseguir tudo
minhas questões de matemática estão certas,
Eu posso andar de bicicleta até
escola com Becky Feder.
Realmente? Ok, Bean, bem,
quanto é sete mais nove?
Setenta e nove.
Ele é um garotinho
ou um computador?
Porque eu não consigo entender.
Não destrua a confiança dele.
Feliz verão a todos.
Uau.
Ok, você tem certeza que quer ir
com essas botas, querido?
Eu conheço você
você mesmo os deslumbrou.
Estava só a pensar
se eles atraíssem
muita atenção,
você sabe, do espaço sideral.
É o último dia de aula,
e mamãe diz que estou
livre para me expressar.
Oh, construindo a confiança
aqui mesmo com R2-D2.
Confiança. K-O-B-R-Q-V-Y.
Confiança.
Bem, não vamos precisar
pagar a faculdade.
Isso é certeza.
Bem, parece que um cavalo levou
um lixo na fralda de Ronnie.
Você vai precisar de ajuda federal
para limpar isso.
Ronnie, querido, fez um doo-doo
granada explodiu em sua fralda?
Você vai mudar isso?
Esse não é meu filho,
esse é seu filho.
Ah, ha, ha! Ontem
foi o dia da minha fralda.
Hoje ele é todo seu, e
vai ficar desagradável. Uau!
Vá, Ronnie.
- Vá, Ronnie, vá, Ronnie.
- Vá, Ronnie, vá, Ronnie.
Ele se parece com Nicki Minaj
tentando sacudir a bunda dela
implantes de volta ao lugar.
Vá, Ronnie, vá, Ronnie.
Vamos, Ronnie.
Vá, Ronnie.
Você tem muito
compromissos hoje, querido?
Não, apenas um trabalho de reparo.
Muito especial.
Tudo bem, estou entrando.
O que é...
O que é isso?
Um colar?
Feliz 20º aniversário, querido.
Uau, pai, você se lembrou.
Oh sim.
Mamãe não.
Oh! Isso é frio.
Eu acho que vou
dê o fora daqui.
Então ele sai
o trem e não há ninguém lá?
Braden precisa gastar
pelo menos um verão com você
para que ele possa dizer que tem pai,
seu caloteiro, Higgins.
Bem, para não ser mau,
mas eu nem estou
1.000% de certeza de quem você é.
Eu vim da Flórida.
Em cheio
no meio de um beijo,
Eu fiquei muito mal
caso dos soluços.
Soluços McGee?
Oh, meu Deus, eu tenho um filho que não tenho
sabe sobre Soluços McGee?
E sem ofensa,
mas vou ter que perguntar
para um teste de DNA, você sabe,
porque você nunca...
Não há necessidade.
Mais tarde, Soluços.
Você é ele.
Sim, sem o chapéu.
Na verdade, é uma boa semelhança.
Como você está, cara?
Eu sou seu pai.
Prazer em ver você, Braden.
Esse é o primeiro golpe.
A boa notícia é que você recebe...
Quantidade ilimitada de greves.
Hum...
Que tal eu te levar para a escola?
Nenhuma escola.
Horário de verão.
Oh.
Ainda não. Mais um dia.
Eu sei, é uma chatice.
Normalmente eu deixaria você apenas
acabar com isso e matar aula,
mas estou me voluntariando
na sopa dos pobres hoje,
então, quando eu terminar,
Eu irei buscar você
levante-se e vamos sair.
Eu peguei isso para você, mas...
Obviamente você é,
tipo, 13, então não sei,
mas na verdade é muito legal
e fofo, e você deveria
tire a cabeça disso, ok.
Bem, vamos indo.
Ei, ei,
ei, ei, não se esqueça disso.
É um presente?
Não é
o massacre de Gigglesworth.
Eu disse a Becky que você poderia
costure tudo de volta para ela.
O que?
Marta Stewart
não foi possível consertar isso.
Vamos.
Ah, mas você é um pai tão bom
por pegar todas as peças.
É por isso que estive pensando,
nós voltamos
aqui para sua cidade natal
para que pudéssemos ter mais qualidade
tempo com a nossa família, certo?
Isso mesmo.
Como você faria
sente em expandir?
Ter outro filho?
Hum-hmm. Sim.
Ah, mas é perfeito
agora, sabe?
Se eu comprar uma pizza grande,
Greg ganha duas peças,
Keith ganha dois, Becky ganha
um, você ganha um, eu ganho quatro.
É meio perfeito, você sabe.
eu não quero ter
para comprar outra torta.
Por que você não faz dieta,
gordo gordo ste?
Vamos, eu tive
um emprego desde os 16 anos.
É a primeira vez
Tenho um horário livre.
Estou apenas aproveitando a diversão.
Não se esqueça de Becky
recital de balé às 11h.
Eu tenho que ir para isso?
Quer dizer, eu consigo
ir para isso? Ótimo.
Estou dizendo, isso é... pensei
estava esgotado. Essas são ótimas notícias.
Tenha o melhor último dia de
escola, meus lindos filhos!
Eu amo todos vocês!
Tchau mãe.
Tchau, mãe, tchau.
Sim, último dia de aula, Greg.
Última chance de perguntar
fora Nancy Arbuckle.
Nancy Arbuckle... O que é isso?
Você gosta de uma garota?
É por isso que você está tomando
aqueles banhos longos?
Não, estou condicionando meu cabelo.
Isso é tudo que faço no banho...
Condicione meu cabelo.
Não é isso que
o cervo me contou.
Esse cervo é um mentiroso.
Eu ouvi muito condicionamento
pode fazer você ficar cego.
O que? Onde você ouviu isso?
Higgins.
Eu deveria matá-lo.
Ele é muito covarde
convidá-la para sair, pai,
porque ela é
a garota mais gostosa da escola,
e Greg é feio.
Então, o que ele é feio? Todos
caras da nossa família são feios.
Isso não nos impede de
pegando as gostosas.
Olhe para mim e olhe para sua mãe.
Quer dizer, não faz sentido.
Só em, tipo, Hollywood
filme ou algo assim.
Cada cara em
a escola gosta dela, pai.
E você será o cara
quem acaba com ela.
Você sabe porque? Você vai
siga meu programa de três etapas.
Número um,
faça a garota sorrir.
Número dois, diga a ela
ela tem um belo sorriso.
Número três, diga que ela tem que
sair com você naquela noite.
Por que naquela noite?
Porque isso lhe dá menos tempo para
pense em como você é feio.
Porque você é feio.
Isso é o mais estúpido
coisa que eu já ouvi.
E Keithie está certa... eu também
galinha até para falar com ela.
Ei, você é um Feder. Federadores
não tenho medo de mulheres, amigo.
Isso não é
do jeito que estou criando você.
Ah, a propósito, pai, você perguntou
Mãe, se eu puder jogar futebol?
Não, eu estava com medo.
Receio que ela esteja
vai gritar comigo
naquele sotaque que
ninguém entende.
Vamos, Becky, são 8:00.
A escola começa às 8h15.
Isso significa que nós
só tenho 25 minutos.
Papai, você promete, Sr. Gigglesworth
estará melhor na hora de dormir?
Você vai parar de se preocupar com ele?
Ele vai ficar bem. Eu te amo.
Tenha o melhor último dia, ok?
OK.
Adeus pessoal.
Tchau, papai.
Amo você.
E você leu
as placas de rua, ok?
Não deixe Bean.
Meu Deus,
andando de bicicleta para a escola.
Não foi possível fazer isso em Los Angeles.
com as nozes lá fora.
Sim, porque graças a Deus há
não há pessoas malucas aqui.
Como você está, Nick?
Minha esposa está indo embora
mim depois de três semanas.
Três semanas?
Isso não é ruim para você.
O que aconteceu?
Ela me encontrou comendo
uma banana com minha bunda.
Ah. E ela não gostou disso?
Sim,
ela ficou muito chateada,
mas, você sabe, eu não deveria ter
fez isso na casa da mãe dela.
Sim, você...
Você parece um pouco
extra hoje.
O que está acontecendo?
Sim, estou um pouco medicado.
Conheci um médico muito confiável
em um show em Cypress Hill,
e ele me deu alguns comprimidos
só para se sentir melhor, você sabe.
Mas não me sinto melhor!
Você se sente pior!
Senhoras e senhores,
conheça seu novo motorista de ônibus.
Finalmente consegui um emprego.
Na verdade estou preenchendo
Drool-io Iglesias lá atrás.
Olá, Deanne, feliz aniversário.
Oh! Obrigado, Lenny.
Lenny lembrou.
Não é fofo?
E nunca o engravidei.
Ela esqueceu?
Sim, ela esqueceu.
Não.
Eu consegui a maior saída livre da prisão
cartão do mundo.
Eu quero um desses.
Oh, você nunca consegue um
assim. Oi querido,
eu vou levar
uma carona para o trabalho com Lenny.
Não se preocupe
esquecendo o dia 20.
Tenho certeza que você vai
lembre-se do dia 30.
Eu te amo.
Sim, claro que sim...
Lá no fundo.
Isso não é outro
colar aí, não é?
vou abusar disso
cartão para sair da prisão,
Estou lhe contando agora.
Quero dizer, talvez eu ande no bom
tapete sem tirar as botas.
Oh!
Ou tenha um bom
refrigerante não dietético com meu jantar.
Não apenas um, também,
um maldito jarro.
Ah, então você está virando um gangsta completo.
Oh sim.
Mas você sabe o que
Eu realmente gostaria de fazer?
Jogue um "primeiro
noite de verão".
Sim. Você sabe algo
um pouco louco.
Bem,
já se passaram muitos, muitos anos
já que fizemos
algo louco.
Apenas um problema, no entanto.
Minha casa não é grande o suficiente.
Mas o seu é.
A última festa que dei foi no último ano
ano no ensino médio.
Sim, isso foi, tipo,
a melhor noite da minha vida.
Todos nós ficamos com garotas.
Vamos lá, por que não fazer isso de novo?
Porque nós já
tem pintinhos e filhos
e alto
colesterol agora, então apenas...
É hora de seguir em frente. Você quer
para vir hoje à noite com Dee,
tudo bem... eu acho.
Tenho que perguntar à minha esposa primeiro.
Ok, gangsta.
Ei, ei, onde você conseguiu
aqueles sapatos, Losers "R" Us?
Eu os fiz.
Você os fez?
Em um banheiro?
Aquele garoto é como o Precious branco.
Desaparece, Duffy.
Sim, deixe-a em paz.
Ei, o que você disse, Hollywood?
Você tem algo a me dizer?
Nada, nada, nada.
Atenção, compradores do Kmart,
vamos encontrar um lugar, por favor.
Sim,
você com a jaqueta camuflada
e penteado de Mariah Carey.
Sim,
apenas agache-se, obrigado.
Você tem sorte de seu pai estar aqui,
mas ele não estará aqui o dia todo.
Me deixe em paz.
Beanbag com braços e pernas,
sério, sente-se,
ou assentos,
antes que alguém se machuque.
Você está morto, cara.
eu vou pegar
algumas coisas feitas,
e então eu vou para o meu
recital de balé da filha,
então você está no seu
possuir até a hora do almoço.
Ah, não se preocupe.
Ninguém entrará de qualquer maneira.
Certo.
Leonardo
já falou sobre mim?
Leonardo?
Seu marido.
Ah, Lenny.
Eu provavelmente deveria ter te contado
isso antes de começar a trabalhar aqui,
mas ele costumava ser meu namorado.
Oh.
Quando vocês saíram?
Sexto ano.
Desta vez,
partimos um pedaço de chiclete no recreio.
Eu trouxe uma nota
que ele me enviou, e eu
pensei que você deveria ver.
Eu simplesmente me senti estranho
ter um segredo com você.
"Você gosta mais do meu cabelo
em uma presilha ou uma bandana?"
Foi isso que escrevi.
"Barreta."
E essa foi a resposta dele.
Isso te incomoda
que eu ainda uso?
Ah, não, não, não,
Eu acho que é fofo.
Eu acho que ele ainda
tem sentimentos por mim.
Vou malhar agora.
Você acha mesmo
que um corpo firme e tonificado
irá mantê-lo longe
de seu bebê Hubba Bubba?
Espero que sim. Tchau.
Você acabou de mexer com
a garota errada, chica!
Eles pintaram meu bebê com spray.
Puxa, e
está tudo escrito certo.
Estes não podem ser meus alunos.
Oh!
Tenha um bom dia, Rapunzel.
Ei,
gente, vocês acreditam nisso?
O calendário muda para junho,
meus alunos maravilhosos,
eles se tornam animais.
Talvez eles sejam apenas
louco por você continuar
para o bebêGap para
compre suas roupas.
Olá, Diretor Tardio,
bom dia.
Direito à aula, direito à aula.
Como foi sua última viagem em
antes do verão, Nick?
Lembrar,
hoje é apenas meio dia.
E meia camisa, certo?
O que?
Eu disse que ele quer se despedir de você.
Oh, tudo bem.
Aqui vai ele.
Estou animado com o verão,
também.
Ei, esse é o meu laptop!
Isso não é à prova d'água!
Menino macaco, menino macaco.
Verão!
Menino macaco.
Verão!
Verão! Verão!
Então, o que você acha?
Te levo direto para o trabalho?
Eu tenho um
compromisso que eu tenho que ir
em algum momento entre 8:00 da manhã. m.
e 4:
OK.
Mas ela pode esperar.
Bom. E veja isso.
Ele está de volta.
Por que ele não está no trabalho?
Ele é apenas...
Esta mulher tem um controle sobre ele.
É ridículo.
Isso vai arruinar o casamento dele.
Obrigado pelo café da manhã, mamãe.
Você virá para assistir
Dias de nossas vidas depois?
Bem, precisamos descobrir qual
gêmeo assassinado Renaldo, certo?
Claro que sim.
Hum-hmm.
- OK.
- Olá, Sra. Lamonsoff,
bom te ver.
Belo ônibus escolar, Lenny.
Obrigado. Tenha um ótimo dia.
Mamãe fez
o boo-boo vai embora?
Não conte para a esposa.
O que vocês estão fazendo?
Entrem.
Olá, Nick.
Legal. Legal.
Vamos acertar.
Vê isto.
Oh!
Uau.
Você tem que respeitar isso.
Isso foi incrível.
Qual é o problema de Lenny? Eles estão
tão fofos quando são pequenos.
Eu sei. Tenho saudade.
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
Você sente falta disso? Realmente?
Ficar. Ficar.
Não rosne para mim.
Fique, querido, fique.
Com licença.
Seu filho vai estar aqui
quando o instrutor chega?
Esse não é meu filho.
Esse é meu amante,
e ele é muito gentil.
Crianças não pertencem aqui.
Essa coleira
é melhor não me enganar.
Leash não vai te enganar.
É o seu homem grande e peludo
pés que vão te fazer tropeçar.
Ela estava apenas
brincando, senhor.
Acalme-se.
Você vai nos matar.
Desculpe.
Estou tendo o pior dia.
Bem-vindo ao Squat Fitness,
senhoras.
Aparentemente o seu novo instrutor
atrasado um pouco.
Desculpe.
Faltam apenas cinco para...
Sim, então ele me pediu para liderar
você em alguns exercícios de aquecimento.
Então, pessoal, de pé,
e vamos respirar fundo.
Bom.
Mais profundo... Realmente
esticar esses pulmões.
E agora vamos dançar.
Sacudir
os ombros para frente e para trás.
Agite-os.
Muito bom, muito bom.
Sim, ah, sim.
Agora vamos fazer alguns
agachamento com britadeira.
Certo, coloque as mãos na frente
de você assim. Apenas relaxe.
E então agache-se
e para baixo, mas rápido.
Mais rápido, mais rápido, pronto.
Muito depressa.
Rápido rápido.
Muito rápido.
Faça isso um pouco mais devagar.
Agora, todos se voltam,
de frente para o fundo da sala,
curvar,
e alcance os dedos dos pés.
Por que temos que nos virar?
Por favor.
E incline-se como
tão baixo quanto você pode ir.
Agora pegue a mão direita e dê um tapa
contra a bochecha direita.
Relaxe o pulso e dê um tapa
aquela bunda certa, dê um tapa.
Bom, eu quero ouvir esse tapa.
Ah, sim, isso é maravilhoso.
Bom dia, senhoras.
Você começou sem mim?
Sim, exatamente como você me pediu.
Diga que é verdade, mesmo que não seja.
O que?
Ah, você adorou!
Você adorou!
Sim, esse é o meu garoto.
Tudo bem.
Vocês são todas prostitutas!
De qualquer forma. Eu sou Kyle,
e bem vindo ao verão
sessão de Squatrobics 101.
Eu gostaria que eles ligassem
é outra coisa,
mas é isso que
eles me disseram para dizer.
OK,
então, antes de começarmos de verdade,
alguma pergunta?
Sim.
Você é casado?
Não.
Não, estou... estou solteiro.
Hum...
Sim.
Eu esqueci. Você é tão
lindo, minha cabeça está girando.
Desculpe. Deus.
Vá em frente.
Eu tenho uma pergunta muito importante,
e é uma dupla.
A primeira parte
a questão é,
“Será que um cientista
fazer você em um laboratório?"
E a segunda parte
da questão é,
"Posso enfiar minha língua na sua
garganta, por favor?"
Tudo bem, pessoal, olhem,
Fico lisonjeado. Sério, cara,
mas a maioria de vocês é casada
e acontece que eu sou gay.
Claro que ele é.
Todos eles.
Isso é péssimo!
Que desperdício!
Fique fora da minha bolsa, homenzinho.
Por que ela tem isso?
Isso não é uma cinta esportiva,
isso é um fio dental.
Bem, bem, bem,
se não for Hollywood
e as Praças.
Ei, Malcolm, eu não
sei que você trabalhou no Kmart,
e aparentemente o cabelo em cima
sua cabeça também não sabia disso.
O que?
Faça-me um favor, vá assim.
Eu acho que consegui
algo em meus dentes.
O que?
Você sabe,
da próxima vez, você deve usar isso
Coisas de Chia Pet em toda a sua cabeça.
O que?
Por que Higgins está comprando
A faca de O.J. agora?
Você se acha durão?
Olá, Malcom,
é que a faca dos índios
costumava escalpelar você?
Eu nem entendo isso.
O que?
Oh, vamos lá, vamos animá-lo
Estilo Benny Hill.
Aqui vamos nós.
Vamos,
Venha, venha, venha...
Isso faz você se sentir melhor?
Ei, Crocodilo Dumb-dee,
como foi com o garoto?
Bom Bom. Ele está na escola.
O garoto vai à escola por um dia?
Eu não sabia mais o que fazer.
Ele é um bandido, Lenny.
Ele cortou a cabeça de um ursinho de pelúcia.
Imagine o que ele fará comigo.
Então você vai comprar
isso para cortar a cabeça dele?
Não, eu só quero que ele pense
vou cortar a cabeça dele
então ele não vai
cortar minha cabeça.
Você quer assustar um parente
sem causar danos permanentes?
Posso sugerir isso?
Ahhh!
Senhor?
Senhor? Você pode sair da cama?
É hora de acordar.
Sim, tudo bem, vovó, estou de pé!
Pare de gritar comigo.
Agora, por que... Ser mau?
Eu gosto de dormir aqui.
É que você sempre grita.
Você não precisa gritar comigo.
Eu te amo.
Eu não entendo.
Limpeza, corredor nove.
Saia de mim!
E traga uma pá.
Então, meu filho Bumpty me contou
ele vai perguntar à sua filha
saiu em um encontro na escola hoje.
Em primeiro lugar, a minha filha nunca
já saiu em um encontro antes,
e tenho certeza que ela não vai começar
sair com um garoto chamado Bumpty.
Ele é o único outro
garoto negro em sua série.
Espere, você a quer
namorar um cara branco?
Sim, Farrakhan.
Prefiro que ela namore o mais branco
cara branco no mundo
do que o seu pequeno
garoto careca.
Tudo bem, mas, você sabe,
não se preocupe quando ela disser sim,
porque eu já
tive uma conversa com ele.
Que conversa?
Namorando.
Eu disse a ele como costumávamos rolar
com as senhoras do ensino médio.
Você sabe, bip-bip.
O que?
Eu deveria pegar um pouco
spray de pimenta para meu filho.
Algum idiota no ônibus
continua mexendo com ele,
e ele se recusa a revidar.
Você sabe, isso me lembra
de alguém que conheço.
Quem?
Você.
O que você está falando?
Entrei em muitas brigas.
Lembre-se da nona série
quando Tommy Cavanaugh
mudou do Texas para cá?
Ele abusou de você sem parar,
e você não fez nada a respeito.
Tommy Cavanaugh
era uma aberração roid.
Ele tinha espinhas nas costas
nas costas, espinhas.
Além disso, ele estava
brincando comigo.
Se fosse real, juro por Deus,
Eu o teria nocauteado.
Ei, não é isso
Cavanaugh aí?
Onde?
Peguei vocês.
Isso foi muito engraçado,
cara, muito engraçado.
Ei, você não estava
exatamente Capitão Corajoso
quando nós estávamos
crescendo, agora, você estava?
Ei, eu nunca apoiei
fora de uma luta, no entanto.
Sim, mas você já pulou
do Suicídio 35 na pedreira?
Ah, isso mesmo.
Ele sempre inventava um
desculpa esfarrapada para não fazer isso.
O que você está falando?
“Ah, não posso.”
"Estou menstruada.
Isso atrairá tubarões. "
Suicídio 35 na rocha superior.
35 pés acima da água.
Minha mãe deu aquele salto quando ela estava
grávida de mim.
Tem uma jangada aí?
Uau!
Quem fez isso?
Tudo bem, passarinhos.
Encontre seus ninhos, cara.
Flutue para baixo.
Lá vamos nós e entramos.
Tudo bem, pessoal,
normalmente não temos coisas emocionantes
notícias tão tarde no semestre,
mas temos um novo aluno ingressando
nós hoje, Braden Higgins.
Ei, há um vazio
sente ali, cara.
Por que você não vai fazer uma ocupação?
Ou vá por ali, cara.
Siga seu próprio caminho.
Não.
Está aqui.
Seu pai é Marcus Higgins?
Sim, eu o conheço desde que era bebê.
Ele é o mais engraçado.
O melhor. Ótimo, ótimo homem.
Eu quero quebrar a cara dele.
Sim eu também.
Sim, eu odeio esse cara.
Dane-se ele.
Ei, Charlotte,
espere, espere. Pergunta...
Como você gostaria de gastar
a primeira noite do verão
com um novato hardcore?
O que isso significa?
Acho que ele está te convidando para sair.
Ele é?
Você é?
Eu não invento coisas.

Page 21/69

Well, can Donna come?
Three's a crowd, McCloud.
No, he didn't.
Yes, he did.
It's okay, Charlotte.
It's a date, your first date.
Just you two.
All right. I mean,
I'd have to ask my parents,
but I think that would be okay.
Hey, Bumpty.
You think just because
it's the last day of school,
you can sit and
socialize the entire period?
I don't think about stuff
like that, Lady Shorts.
Well, can you think fast?
Ow!
Who wants to
watch me climb a rope?
Yeah!
Ugh.
Oh, you're the man!
Whoo!
Yo, he's got to put those
Easter eggs back in the basket.
Dang!
Kelly, I don't want to hear it!
Oh, I can't take it anymore!
I wish I never had you!
Oh! Stop it! Stop it!
See, that's why I
don't want four kids.
Yeah, people with four just
lose their minds. Yeah.
They're yelling,
they're screaming.
Sometimes they go to jail
just to get some sleep.
Hold up. Hang on.
I got a burpsnart coming.
Uh-oh.
Ho ho!

Page 22/69

Come on.
You got to teach
me how you do that.
A burpsnart? It's simple.
Yeah.
You just start with a burp,
then you sniff for a sneeze,
you get that going,
and that
triggers a fart, always.
What's up with this school bus?
Okay. I stole it.
What?
Put your hands in the air.
And wave them like you
just don't care "ho"
Oh!
Say "ho"
Oh!
I heard you're having
a party tonight, Lenny.
What? I'm not
having a party.
Where did you hear that?
He's a cop.
He hears everything.
Oh, God.
Look, it's Magnum P.U.
Look at him getting all serious.
I still can't believe
you're a cop after all the
sick stuff you did growing up.
The Peter Dante who stole
your parents' snowmobile
and sold it to purchase
crack cocaine is dead, Feder.
This side of
the law is way better.
To serve and protect.
Got to love it.
Hey, McKenzie, I heard you
assaulted somebody in there.
I didn't assault anybody. I
just choked out your brother.

Page 23/69

Yeah, he deserves it.
He's crazy.
We got five minutes
to get to that stupid recital.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Recital?
At McDonough Elementary?
Yes.
Can I come?
Why?
Trust me.
Everybody's got to go.
We got five minutes. We're
never gonna make it there.
You'll get there on time,
'cause we're gonna give you a
four-alarm presidential police escort.
Isn't that against the law?
I am the law!
What's happening?
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
What just happened?
Welcome, parents, to final
performance of school year,
our June-a-licious
Dance Spectacular!
Now, for this year,
we go throwing a few
hip-hop moves in there.
Like this.
Is fun to dance.
Let the show begin.
So nice of you to invite your
friends and the bus driver
and the police force to our
daughter's dance recital.
Yeah, huge ballet fans,
all of them.
- Ooh!
- Oh.
She's so cute.
So cute.
She's adorable, isn't she?
She is adorable.

Page 24/69

Fantastic stuff.
Unbelievable.
Look at her go.
I am.
I'm looking at her.
I want to arrest her
for disturbing the peace.
In my pants.
I'm having a wonderful time.
She's got a solo?
What?
It's fine.
I just wish that you
would give me more
than eight hours notice
before you tell me that
we're throwing a party, babe.
It's not a party.
Get out of here.
It's a couple people coming by.
Come on.
How'd you like it?
You were great, honey.
Hey!
Where did you learn
to dance like that?
She moves like "Yagger," no?
Yes,
she does, she moves like...
Mick Yagger?
Is that what you were saying?
Hey, butter buns,
you ready to grab some eats?
Yes.
Cavanaugh.
Lenny Feder, I'll be damned.
Honey, this is Tommy Cavanaugh.
He was my old steroid
that I grew up with.
This is my...
Wife, Roxanne.
Why are your
hands shaking, Daddy?
My hands are shaking?

Page 25/69

Probably because I
had too much coffee
this morning, sweetheart.
I heard you been running around
saying you could
take me in a fight.
You... I wouldn't say that.
Yeah, you did,
this morning in Kmart.
Kmart? Was I there?
I don't think I was there.
You know,
all I can
remember about this guy
is smacking him around
whenever I wanted to,
and him not doing
a single thing about it.
Yeah, we had a lot of good
times like that growing up.
Why is your voice so shaky, Daddy?
Are you crying?
You don't stop talking, do you?
Honey,
we should be getting going.
Sure, baby.
I want you to stop making up
lies about kicking my ass
or I'm gonna have
to set you straight.
Sure, sure, sure.
I'll see you around.
Becky,
you be having great summer.
I was one inch away
from knocking that guy out,
and I swear to God.
No, you weren't.
This is grown-up talk,
so butt out!
That's insane!
What did you say to him?
I said, "Hey, Cavanaugh, you
speak to me like that again"

Page 26/69

"in front of my wife and kid, I will
brush your teeth with a brick. "
No, you didn't.
You just yelled at me.
I don't yell at you!
Calm down.
No, I'm just saying.
You guys were in the bathroom.
Look who's here, everybody.
20 VOSS waters, right?
That's how they do it in Hollyweird.
I don't know.
We haven't lived there in, what,
10 months now or something?
As a matter of fact, our son
starts work here tonight.
I know. I heard you
brown-nosed Mr. Pappas
and now Showbiz
Junior's got a job.
I used to scoop cones here,
and why shouldn't he?
It's a great
first job for a kid.
Or lifetime job.
Okay, what are we having?
Becky, what do you want, hon?
Can I have the soft
chocolate cup, please?
Here's a word you
probably never heard, no.
The machine's busted, princess.
Aw, bummer, it's broken?
Like all your dreams?
You know what, it's easy to fix.
I can help you with that.
What do you know about fixing
ice cream machines, Higgins?
Uh, I went to DeVry for a year.
Oh, that's right.
I can fix anything with a plug.
Including your hair?
That's not true. I don't even
know how that got started.

Page 27/69

That's, like, people are
saying that around town.
I'll walk you through it.
You just walk up, climb up the
machine, lean over the back.
Can't believe I'm
listening to this idiot.
Listen to the man.
You're gonna see
two pipes coming into the top.
Yes!
In between them,
there's gonna be
a silver button.
Hit it a little bit.
Push hard.
No. Hit it with your fist.
Yeah, just push the button.
I got it.
There we go!
I think we're
getting somewhere.
Okay, keep going. Yeah, that...
Force it. That's it.
Hey! Why is Dickie crapping
all over the ice cream stand?
What'd she say?
Nothing! Nothing!
Go! Just go!
Go, Dickie!
That's where ice
cream comes from?
And so we've reached the end
of another school year.
Froot Loop?
Ten months
of learning, growth
and, yes, hopefully,
a little bit of fun.
But the journey we began
together, in September,
does not end today.
For education is a process
that does not begin and end
on some set schedule...
Please let me finish.
Return to your seats.
Damn you!
Every year, you do this to me!
And this was my favorite shirt
from when I was 12!
How you doing, sophomore?
Not bad, sophomore.
Come here!
Hey, you're not a statue.
You're an ass-tue.
Doesn't even make any sense.
Shut up!
What? What? What?
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
What's up, man?
Your dad picking you up?
Uh, I don't know.
I told him it'd be cool if he
stayed late at the soup kitchen,
so it's on me.
Well, you can come on the bus
with us, if you want.
Nah, how about we
do something fun?
How about we do something
we're not supposed to?
"Keep out. "
That just makes me
want to not keep out.
Heard our dads used to come
swimming here, back in the day.
They claim to be all squeaky
clean, but I think they were nuts.
College kids.
We better go.
No go.
Stay.
Whoo!
He's nuts.
Let's go.
Hey!
Where are you guys going?

Page 29/69

Join the party.
Here. One and two.
Are you guys freshmen?
No. We're seniors.
We just became seniors,
like, 20 minutes ago.
Not high school seniors,
college seniors.
Wait a minute!
I remember you guys.
You're Scully.
You're Boomer.
Come here.
I love you guys so much.
I love you, too.
Girl, I love you more.
I'm gonna go.
Whoo! Body shots!
No go.
Stay.
Okay, okay. But what
about these beers, man?
If we don't drink them,
they'll be onto us,
and I'm not sure I'm
ready for beer yet.
Wait, let's just dump them
when no one's looking,
then act like we're drunk.
Okay. Good idea.
All right, let's go.
Summertime.
You're sure you want to do this, big man?
No shame in backing down.
Really?
Come on!
Come on.
It's a lifelong shame.
You're finally doing
Suicide 35. It's a big day.
What are you scared of, man?
You're the "rope from the tree,
triple flip, bird-crush" guy.
I'm not scared of this.

Page 30/69

In the past, I did it before.
But I'll do it right now.
Sure. Sure. Go ahead.
- Do it. Do it.
- Whoa.
But the thing is this,
I just...
late about 45 minutes ago.
What did you eat?
I had chicken chow mein.
Chicken chow mein? When did...
We were with you
the whole time!
Yeah. You didn't see it?
They had it at Kmart.
They have chicken chow...
Oh, get out of here.
It's good there. Yeah.
It's very good.
What do I hear right now?
Look at this.
Beers on ice.
Hot ladies everywhere.
This is how we used to do it.
This is howl
still do it, buddy.
He does still do it that way.
Well, you should stop.
This is Kappa
Eta Sigma property.
So you might want to quit
perving on our ladies
and get back to your trailer homes.
Okay, easy there, Abercrombie.
I think it's...
I think we've been around
a little longer than you.
Been swimming here
since we were eight years old,
so you can calm
down a little bit.
I'm sure it was the bomb!
Cranking your Al Jolson tunes
on your transistor radio.

Page 31/69

But it's the 21st century now.
And Thicky-Thick
and the Flabby Bunch
should never take
their shirts off again.
That hurts.
Okay,
I guess I'm Thicky-Thick.
Yeah, well, I don't like being
in the Flabby Bunch, either.
Boom! That just happened.
I haven't been around this many
arrogant white college kids
since Eminem played Duke.
There it goes. And then...
Boom!
That just happened.
How was that?
At least we got into college,
skinny Danny Glover.
Long handjob.
That's Rock, Paper, Scissors.
I think it's over.
Hey, hey, hey!
What, what, what?
What?
And a little extra right there.
Hey, fellows,
that was a good handshake.
We got a good one, too.
It goes like this.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, how you doing, sir?
Nice to see you.
Very good, sir.
Beautiful day.
Yeah, at least we're not stuck
in some crap town like this, hanging
up drywall for the rest of our lives.
Bay-oom!
Hanging drywall?
First of all,
I'll have you know
that I own pretty much

Page 32/69

the greatest auto body shop
in town, all right?
This guy works for
the cable company.
Free cable for life.
What?
Over here, you know Higgins?
That's right, he works part-time
down at the go-kart track.
Oh, so he was highballing
you with the drywall.
Boom!
This just got real.
Real stupid? What happened?
Something's real.
Yeah...
Dougie, Dougie...
Are you guys as wasted as us?
Hells, yeah!
All the time!
Yo, we're gonna let you guys continue
your Klan meeting in a minute.
He's just gonna jump off of
here, and then we'll leave.
I can't permit that.
I can't permit it!
Can't permit it.
You guys have ruined
our celebration by being here.
Look at my hands, huh?
They're shaking, I'm so mad.
Yeah,
look, my brother's shaking.
Wha... Wha...
Whoa, whoa.
That was a cool move.
Now, listen to me.
I'm gonna kick this kid's ass.
But I need, like, 11 to 15
minutes to stretch out, okay?
I got to stretch.
It's overlooked.
No, I understand.
I can't fight these kids.

Page 33/69

I'm skinny Danny Glover.
Guys, this guy's doing 11 flips
behind you for
some unknown reason.
We got kids,
we can't afford to do this.
Buddy, dude, you don't have
to do that last flip.
Don't, like, get hurt.
We'll come back another time.
You will come back never!
This is Kappa Eta Sigma property!
Dude,
why are you acting so crazy?
Did Betty White
just call you crazy?
Did he just call you Betty White?
Betty White?
That's pretty funny.
We've got a situation!
You know what?
Hey, guys? Guys?
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Let's get out of here.
Listen,
it's nice to meet everybody.
We're gonna take off,
but let's do this again.
Take care, guys.
Enjoy yourself.
Not that way.
Oh, is there an elevator?
That way.
Oh, come on, are you serious?
You gonna make us jump?
Naked.
Asshole.
Oh!
You guys are losers.
Oh!
Don't worry, it gets bigger.
Ahh!
Whoa!
Oh!

Page 34/69

That poor old lady!
Ahh! Ah ha ha!
I'm paralyzed!
I'm in so much pain!
Mama!
No!
Oh!
I was inside you!
I can't believe nobody's even
scared of a black guy anymore!
Damn you, Obama!
What the hell just happened?
I saw my dad's dick.
Well, the good news is Lamonsoff
finally did the jump for real.
And the bad news is
he landed on my face.
What are you,
made of rocks, dude?
Check this out, feel this.
I'm not kidding you.
Right up here.
I think even higher.
Feel that.
And?
Put your hand right there.
Feel the other one.
Those are my balls.
I'm not kidding you,
they went way up in there.
You're getting me turned on.
Are you kidding me?
What?
They slashed our tires!
These kids won't
stop abusing us!
Damn you!
This wasn't college kids.
It was my son, Satan.
And why is this kid so angry?
His mom hiccupped a lot, but
she was happy! And hot.
If she's so hot,
why don't you make her

Page 35/69

your late-night booty call?
Oh, Beefcakes!
Come on, baby!
You've been sneaking around with Fabio?
It's not funny, dude! She's gonna
kick the crap out of me later!
Wow.
Wow.
A little
five-hour Energy, huh?
Yeah.
500-hour Energy?
I drink it for the taste, okay?
Oh, my God, you gonna jog
to Florida after this?
Oh!
No!
A bonus!
Come on,
just cram yourself in there.
My body, it's just too big for this thing.
I can't fit.
Higgins, dummy, hop in
this thing for a minute.
For what?
Just get in the tire.
No way! In there?
Five yards we'll roll you.
We've done it. I would do
it if I could get in there.
This is peer pressure,
you're bullying.
And I promise you
I'll stop you and I love you.
Don't let him do it.
He's jacked up on juice.
And a-one, and a-two...
Mommy's got you.
...and a-three!
Okay, five feet.
Grab me. Y'ello.
Lenny!
Hey, Keithie.
Meet me at the football field,

Page 36/69

but don't tell your mother.
Why am I still rolling?
Lenny!
Oops.
Help!
Guys. get me!
Hang in there!
I'm going downhill!
Lenny! No! No!
When will it end?
Oh, yeah.
Summer is here, man!
Help! Stop! No!
Tire on the loose!
Fluzoo, shotgun, now!
Someone!
Higgins is in the tire!
Of course.
- Help!
- Get there!
Help!
Liar!
No, no, baby!
No! No! Someone!
Ahh! Ahh!
Shaw's over, tire.
Ow!
I'm next.
I got next!
No, I'm next!
It's my tire! My turn!
Hey!
What happened?
I got a phone call.
Oh.
Okay. I forgive you.
Was it
long-distance or something?
Don't want to kick a guy
while he's down, Higgins,
but we caught your son
with a can of spray paint
looking like he
was up to no good.

Page 37/69

You lied about the soup.
You lied about the soup!
We are gonna find
those fartheads,
and we are gonna kill them.
Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
No, guys! Not each other!
We're not killing each other!
Keithie, Keithie, Keithie!
Whoo! Uh-huh!
It's a practice, Donna. You
don't have to go full speed.
Sorry, Mr. Feder.
It's fine!
Hey, look at these
giant mooses out there.
You don't want to get
in the middle of all that.
Plus, the kicker,
honestly, is like,
one of the most
important guys on the team
and you don't have
to worry about getting
your head bashed in every play.
I get it, Dad.
I'm a wimp.
You're not a wimp.
It's just common sense.
Avoid big idiots
trying to hurt you.
I was trying to
avoid a big idiot
trying to hurt me on
the bus this morning,
but he wouldn't leave me alone.
Well, sometimes they
won't let you avoid them,
and you just... You can't back
down in those situations.
I'm telling you,
I've backed down a few times,
it's not a good feeling.

Page 38/69

All right, look, let's just
kick a few field goals.
It's like soccer,
which you're great at.
All you got to do is put your
foot right through the ball.
Whoo!
What?
Touchdown! Yeah!
Yeah!
That's ridiculous!
Your first try?
All right,
we're backing up, boy.
That was totally awesome, Keithie!
That was so cool!
That was just, like, awesome!
Okay, drive through the ball.
Drive through the ball.
It's up!
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo! Go, Keithie!
Yes! What did you
eat this morning?
All right, this is starting to
get into, like, college level.
From the 30!
Who the hell is this kid?
Oh, my God!
Stop! Keithie time!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
I'm starting to think
she has a little crush on you.
Really?
Either that or she got bit
by a poisonous spider.
Keithie! Whoo!
All right, let's see how you do
in a real game situation,
though.
Okay? Let's
pretend I'm a linebacker,
and I'm gonna come at you
and try and block it.

Page 39/69

Okay.
Set!
Hike! I'm a crazy linebacker!
Give me that football!
Oh, my leg!
Keithie!
Don't tell your mother!
All right, that kid's dead.
Back to work.
Now, you remember how to do
a five-point turn, right?
Yeah.
Parallel park?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, don't "yeah,
yeah" me, dumb-ass.
You're precious cargo.
Now, if you mess around
and get yourself killed,
I'm gonna have to kill you.
Look, Dad, I'm ready
for this, all right?
You're late.
Hello, McKenzie.
Hey, Wiley, how you feeling?
Oh, just two years of this.
And I still only have
40% feeling in my body.
Otherwise, I'm fine.
No, Rihanna's fine.
You just teach driver's ed.
Get her done, son!
And remember
everything we talked about!
Defensive driving!
Stop at all yellows!
Obey the laws!
You moron!
Look out!
Be safe!
Don't do what I just did!
Hey, officers,
you guys want to stick around
and have a drink with me,

Page 40/69

hang out a little bit?
You're afraid of us leaving you
alone with your son,
aren't you?
My son... Are you
kidding me? I don't care...
Boo!
He's got a knife!
That sounds dangerous.
How far was the drop?
Just 35 feet.
Who do you think
you are, Tarzan?
It's no big deal.
Honey?
Hi, Sally.
Hi, honey.
I... No, I just came to see
if Mommy was alive.
And looking now,
she's breathing, she's good.
Hi. What are you doing here?
I was bringing your mother
a new fan for the summer.
That's good.
You said you couldn't
get coffee with
me because you had
a 3:
with a Mr. Renaldo.
Hello, ladies!
You!
Can't be!
We killed you. Last week.
You actually think
two amateurish nitwits
could kill The Great Renaldo?
I told you.
You did. You called it.
So the leg's not
really broken, huh?
No, it is broken, right here.
Just a hairline fracture,

Page 41/69

though.
No, it's a clean break.
Slight, though.
Slight? No. It's broken.
Broken-broken or just broken?
It's a broken leg.
What was once one bone
is now two half-bones.
Right.
Is there anything you can do
about my wife staring at me?
No, I'm not a psychiatrist.
So you're saying
my wife is crazy?
No, no. I was joking.
Like you were when you said
his leg is broken.
Look, your son
is going to be wearing
that cast the entire summer.
If you don't mind,
I haven't slept in 68 hours.
So you're a little
loopy from lack of sleep,
and that really
isn't my son's bone.
That's a piece of
celery you snapped.
Lenny!
Yes?
The leg is broken!
You can't undo this,
and you lied to me,
so you're gonna pay for it.
Doctor, wouldn't it be nice
if there was a cure for anger?
There is.
It's called Jack Daniel's.
Another one of your jokes, huh?
I Wish.
Okay, the light is red
now, so just remain stopped.
Scully, is that you?
Scully!

Page 42/69

Hey, what's up, fellas?
Are you taking your
driver's test drunk?
Yeah, I'm MC Hammered!
Oh! You're a madman!
Psychopath, man!
Hey, Scully, Scully.
Have you seen those old townies
from the quarry today?
No, I can't say I did. Why?
They
disrespected our frat house!
Man, they disrespected
the crap out of it!
Oh, no, can't have that.
Brewski time, dude!
It's not for you, Scully.
It's for that freak
in the hat next to you.
Looks like he needs it.
Boom!
Yeah!
That just happened!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Taking your driver's
test while intoxicated?
Minus five points.
This is ridiculous!
I've wasted an entire day waiting
for this idiot to show up.
Did you tell him your son-in-law
works for the cable company?
A fat lot of good being related
to that bozo would do me.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
Love to the children.
Yes. Yes.
Damn it, I just sat down.
I'll be right out there!
Hang on!
I'm coming as quick as I can.
I got bunions, damn it!
No! No!
You burn in hell!

Page 43/69

You cable-installing mother...
Oh, damn it!
Look, man,
I know deadbeat dads
always have lame excuses
why they don't see their kids,
but "I didn't know you existed
till about a week ago"
is actually a fantastic excuse.
So can you cut me some slack?
Her name's not Hiccups McGee.
Yeah, I know that.
So why do you call her that?
No, that's just...
It's stupid.
It's just kind of
a nickname I give people that,
you know, have a distinct
trait or physical feature.
Like, if someone had big lips,
you'd call them Lippy McGee.
And if they sneezed a lot,
you'd call them Sneezy McGee.
Oh, so you'd be Ugly McGee.
I'd be Ugly McGee.
Exactly.
Shorty McGee.
Shorty McGee, sure.
Viagra McGee.
Right, right.
You get it, you get it.
Listen, man,
I'm willing to give
this a try if you are.
You know what they say... Yesterday's
history, tomorrow's a mystery.
Maybe we go inside
and search the Internet
for funny videos of
squirrels waterskiing.
Okay, we're getting somewhere.
I'm sorry I lied
about the appointment.
The lying's not the worst part.

Page 44/69

You hid from me at your
mother's house, Eric.
Who does that?
Look, she's nice to me.
You know,
she always takes my side,
worries if I'm eating enough
and taking my vitamins.
I do all that stuff, too, Eric.
Okay, I don't.
You're right.
You know, there's only
so many hours in a day,
and I'm always
running around the kids,
and I guess I
leave you out a lot,
and I'm really gonna try harder
to make you feel special,
'cause you always make me feel
like the only girl in the world.
I feel bad.
Don't feel bad.
No, I do,
because today at the recital,
I couldn't stop
looking at Becky's teacher.
I don't mind you looking.
I really don't.
Everybody looks.
I was looking today.
And I'm totally fine with that.
As long as he was gay,
dead or a cartoon.
Gay.
Okay.
But no matter who
or what we look at,
we'll always come back
to each other, right?
Car wash!
Car wash! Whoo!
Support our team!
I'll prove it to you!

Page 45/69

Car wash!
What are you doing?
No, no, you're gonna like this.
Hi, girls!
Come on.
Honey,
you don't have to do this.
I want to.
Hi, girls!
Wash it up extra soapy!
You got it.
Oh, wait, hang on. There's a
car just in front of you.
Better do them first.
Yo, got a customer!
You take these guys,
we'll take the yellow car.
Extra soapy.
Oh, what is
happening right now?
I swear, I didn't plan this.
No, no, no, no. Thank you. I'm good.
I'm good, thank you.
Well, I might as
well enjoy this.
Why is this never-ending?
At least the guys in the car
in front of us are having fun.
What are you doing?
Get in there!
Let me do it.
Okay, everybody.
It wasn't a perfect day. I admit it.
There were some downs.
Sorry about the leg.
The good news is
the children got through
another year of school.
Fabulously.
You got older, even though
I told you not to. Especially you.
Stay young. Don't leave me.
You prepared us your famous
chicken la food poisoning,

Page 46/69

which we're all excited to eat.
I'm just kidding.
But the greatest thing is, it's
my favorite part of the day
with my four best friends.
To the Feders!
So Bumpty asked me
out for ice cream today.
I "went out for ice cream"
once with your dad.
Nine months later,
Andre popped out.
This is the best
vanilla pudding I've ever had.
That's butter, son.
Here you go.
Oh, hey.
Want me to come in
and feed it to you
like I did the last time?
No, no. I got my kid here.
That wouldn't be cool.
You said you loved me!
They're not all tens, buddy.
Homeboy, why aren't you eating?
I saw something today
that made me lose my appetite.
What was it, me naked?
What?
What's a burpsmart?
Burpsnorp?
A burpsnart!
Basically, he burps, sneezes
and farts at the same time.
He goes...
I think I just shat myself.
Hey, honey, what time's
that Feder bash tonight?
What?
It's paint.
It doesn't come off.
I thought it might be fun
to have a theme, no?
A theme?

Page 47/69

Roxanne decided the theme is...
The '80s?
That was 70 years ago.
I thought we could
go as Hall & Oates.
Hall & Oates?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is that, like a cereal?
No.
Why don't you
ask Nancy Arbuckle
to come by for
the get-together?
Or do you prefer
the imaginary shower version?
You know what, Charlotte?
I trust you,
and I want you to
have fun tonight.
Really.
What's up, player?
I'm here for your daughter.
What...
Used to get 10 cases
of beer for my parties,
now I get 10
cases of juice boxes.
Hey, Beckster.
Hey, Stud Muffin.
Hey.
Mommy calls him Stud Muffin,
so I call him Stud Muffin.
Is that right?
You must be Roxanne's husband.
I'm Kyle.
How do you know my wife
again there, Mud Stuffing?
I worked her out this morning.
Oh, really?
I worked her out this morning,
too, pretty good.
All right.
Hi.

Page 48/69

What's up?
This is awkward.
My husband's here.
Why is that awkward?
Why?
Well, let me give you a hint.
You have brain damage?
I think we both know
what time it is, don't we?
What time is it?
Oh, nothing.
It's just...
Just time to...
Help me out here.
I'm lost right now. I'm sorry.
Wiley, how'd Andre McKenzie do?
Did he pass his test?
He squeaked by.
We didn't check out
any soapy cheerleaders.
What's going on
with you and my wife?
I'm gonna go.
Actually, why don't we all
go our separate ways.
I don't see any of these
conversations working out for me.
Adios.
I'll see you tonight.
Hey.
I'll bring the Hubba Bubba.
What?
Yeah, party
tonight '80s-style, huh?
Rocky III.
Wiley!
Okay.
Hey, babe.
What does Penny's note say?
Uh...
She wrote,
"Mayonnaise, zitis... "
The other side.
"Meet me by your

Page 49/69

mailbox at 11:
Why would I meet her
by my mailbox at 11:00?
You have any idea
what just happened there?
Not a clue.
I don't care who
your parents are.
You screw up, I fire you.
It's all good.
"It's all good"?
It's a family restaurant,
not a rap show.
It's all bad?
That's right, it is.
You got a customer.
I'm sorry. Welcome to
the Ice Cream House.
Hi, Greg.
Nancy, hi.
I think you crushed your cones.
Oh, no.
That was a...
That was a squeeze test.
These cones failed.
We're gonna try cardboard cones next.
You're smiling.
And number two.
You have such a nice smile.
Thanks.
Go out with me tonight before
your friends say I'm fugly.
Tonight?
Sure.
No freaking way.
Your father used to do
that same three-step crap
when we were growing up.
It always worked then.
Even on my wife.
I ain't no boy with
a mind you can toy,
'cause if this is a ploy,
I'll destroy Illinois.
It is so amazing how you can
freestyle like that.
I been laying it down
truthful since day one.
Well, I sing sometimes, too,
but only, like, in the shower.
I'm scared to sing in
front of other people.
If you scared,
that means you don't got it.
Sorry to be blunt, but I don't front.
I'm hard-core.
Dinosaur!
How long ago was the '80s?
That was way back in the 1900s.
We learned about it in school.
It was wack.
The phones had long, curly
things coming out of the end.
You had to watch commercials.
No way.
Isn't that right, Bowser?
How we doing?
Hey, Dad, why do we have to
wear costumes and you don't?
I am wearing a costume.
Bruce Springsteen,
Born in the U. S.A.
Who's Bruce Springsteen?
I guess some guy
with a giant butt.
Ha.
You don't know who the Boss is?
I stink as a father.
You do not stink as a father.
You're the best father I know.
That's why I don't understand
why you don't...
Why I don't want a baby?
Because I don't want one!
Let's move on from that!
Oh, no. No, no.
Tell her it wasn't

Page 51/69

you talking, Dad.
It was your flabby ass.
You want me to "accidentally"
break the other leg?
Hey, I'm sorry
I raised my voice.
In front of the children!
Right, in front of the kids.
It's just, you...
All you're doing is bringing up
this baby thing over and over.
Are you going through, like,
a "womany" hormone situation
or something?
Menopause?
What, you're not old enough for that?
I'm sorry.
Okay, no,
I meant schizophrenia.
No, honey, honey, honey,
if we have another baby,
we're starting over, you know?
How about we just adopt a kid?
Like
a 20-year-old who has a job.
That way we could
make money off of him.
Oh!
I just... Don't you think we can
start concentrating on me and you?
That's all I'm saying.
It's our time.
Well, I am going through
kind of a hormone thing.
Ah, good,
there's pills for that.
I'm pregnant.
Our guests are here.
Wait a minute,
when did we even have...
Oh.
Damn you, Motel 6 hot tub!
Wow.
Lenny, that's big, brother.

Page 52/69

Yeah, four kids is the best.
What are you
talking about, Prince?
You told me it would be
the worst if that happened.
There's a lot of
great aspects to that.
Like, when Junior graduates
high school, you'll be 64.
How is that a good thing?
Actually, it's horrifying.
I didn't do the math before
I opened my mouth. Sorry.
Whoo. Nice job, Cher.
Okay, I'm not Cher.
I'm Meat Loaf, all right?
Yeah.
You're Meat Loaf,
or you're made of meat loaf?
Who are you, Doug Henning?
I'm Oates.
Where's Hall?
Hall's having
a playdate with your kids.
Anyway, you got nothing
to worry about, Lenny.
All right? You're a great dad.
Right, I know.
I broke my son's leg today.
That's a real good dad.
Guys, you're
bumming me out, all right?
This is supposed
to be party time.
This isn't gonna be a real party.
I'm drinking a juice box,
'cause I'm afraid my
wife's gonna yell at me
for getting drunk
in front of the kids.
How many of you guys have been to
a party in the past six months?
A party without a bouncy house.
A party where they

Page 53/69

actually invited you.
Yeah.
The party's over, fellas.
You saw the way those frat
guys treated us today.
We're irrelevant.
We're losers.
We're old.
Lamonsoff totally surrendered.
He's got a fanny pack on now,
for God's sake.
You know what, first of all,
it's a "survanny" pack,
a survival fanny pack,
with many special features.
So you pull that triangle
and lasagna comes out?
Why don't you give it a shot?
You got it.
I'll pull the string.
Like a raft out of hell!
Yeah, good one, that was good.
Don't ever say
the party's over!
That didn't happen.
Hey, Richard Simmons is a hero.
No, no, no, no, no.
What's with all this Prince?
I'm Prince.
The hell.
You ain't Prince. I'm Prince.
My skin's way
lighter than yours.
You should have came as Seal on
a hunger strike.
You look like Morgan Freeman
if he was a transvestite.
And what you
doing here, Bumpty?
I thought you was
out with my daughter.
That ain't Bumpty.
That's my wife.
Oh, Mary!

Page 54/69

I didn't recognize you.
Where's your costume?
I didn't find out about the
party until it was too late.
So you decided to
come as a black Muppet?
What?
Come on, you're my one and
only, sweetie-boo-mo-mo.
Make a muscle for me?
Pwease?
Ooh!
So bulgy.
Like a big caramel apple.
Wow.
I'm scared.
I feel safe with you.
Shut up.
You know, I can make
a connection with a woman.
I just can't sustain it.
You know,
there's a distance there.
Try to fill it up pharmaceutically,
you know, with pills,
or the Discovery Channel,
or Dino Nuggets.
But nothing really works.
See, you understand, you know?
'Cause you're, I heard,
sensitive to men.
God, he's hot!
Zip it!
He'll find out our secret!
Drink up, partner.
Yeah!
Lenny!
Uh-oh! Secret table.
Yes, honey, how are you?
What's going on?
We just trying to
get our punch on.
Becky's sleepy.
She wants her daddy

Page 55/69

to put her to bed.
Well, Daddy's right about to
enjoy some refreshing punch,
so could you put her to sleep?
Well, you wouldn't want
to have too much punch
with all these
kids running around.
You know what,
I'd be okay with that.
Actually, you wouldn't.
Gotcha.
I'll be back soon, fellas. I'll be
back soon. That's a promise.
Let's go, little girl.
Good night.
Time to go to sleep.
Close your eyes.
Yeah, Mom.
As easy as making a free throw.
Hey, Bean, Becky went to sleep.
I think it's time for you to hit it, pal.
What do you say?
Oh, no, no, don't touch that.
Yeah, you might break it.
What...
Where did you
learn how to do that?
I saw it in one of my dreams.
You're a genius?
My boy's a genius.
Your dad's also a genius.
Sweet dreams there,
angel, okay?
Daddy, can you lay in bed
with me till I fall asleep?
What do you mean? I thought you are sleepy.
That's why we came up here.
Please lay down.
Oh!
I'll lay down with you, then.
I just... There's
a party going on, but...
Can you tell me a story?

Page 56/69

Look who was in
the neighborhood!
Some of Lenny's friends
from the old J. Geils Band!
Daddy?
You don't want one slug?
No.
I thought you liked
this stuff. Sorry.
All right.
I'll tell you a story.
Once upon a time,
there was a hand,
and the hand
faced-raked the child.
Sleep!
Slee...
Sleep!
Boy, Feder's cranking his old rock
and roll records pretty loud.
Guess he's never
heard of neighbors.
Now, why you stopping here?
I need some air.
You need some air?
We haven't even
gotten to the party yet.
I would appreciate it
if you would stop
trying to "manage" me.
Word, word.
Want me to stay
and wait with you?
I just want to be alone!
Yo, don't believe the hype.
Boy!
Daddy, I can't fall asleep
without Mr. Gigglesworth.
You told me he would be okay.
He will be. I...
He just needs to rest
a little bit longer, okay?
Please, Daddy.
I need to see him.

Page 57/69

He had a very rough day.
But I'll get him for you,
because you need to see him.
Doing leg lifts. I work
out when I can, you know?
Want some Daddy
candy right here?
Why are you naked?
Global warming.
Why is this empty?
Where is Gigglesworth?
Hey, hey.
I'm sorry, man.
Were you looking for this?
Why's he look good?
I sewed him.
You sew?
Where'd you learn how to sew?
Gay camp.
You went to gay camp?
You're gay?
No, no. No, I mean, I'm gay,
but no, there's no such thing as
gay camp, man. It was a joke.
I learned to sew from my dad,
who was a tailor.
I've been sewing since
I was Becky's age. Here.
This is great.
Gigglesworth's okay,
you're not fooling
around with my wife,
and you got a pee stain.
That is not mine.
You're an animal.
I am the law!
Oh!
Can you dig it?
Ah!
Come on, big man, Lenny's
got, like, 12 bathrooms.
I don't got to go
to the bathroom.
I'm just enjoying the water.

Page 58/69

Get out.
Hurry! Hurry!
Oh, Fluzoo, come on!
That's not even warm.
It's hot.
I got to give it to
your old man for one thing.
He could always throw a party.
This is my dad's party?
Check out your girlfriend
in the Pat Benatar outfit.
Charlotte,
that was amazing.
Where'd you learn
to sing like that?
No place. I just sing a little
in the shower.
Maybe you should stick to the shower.
'Cause I gots the power
I'm on Today Show
Dissing Matt Lauer
Bumpty!
Do me a favor
and shut your mouth
before I slap that
Mohawk into a chin strap.
What?
Hey.
Who invited you guys?
Your beautiful wife does.
Well, she invited her,
and naturally,
we assumed it was a plus one.
There a problem?
No, I was gonna say,
great Terminator outfit
and Robert Palmer
thing you got on, and...
Nice babble.
- How about this?
- No.
What about that?
Does that hurt?
Is that hurting you?

Page 59/69

Yes, it is hurting me.
Oh. Okay.
Well, let me do it some more.
You got something to say?
Actually, Cavanaugh.
You want to stay at my party,
I think you owe me an apology.
For what?
For back in the day,
always giving me crap.
You don't want to
let bygones be bygones?
I do.
After you apologize to me.
For stuff I did 30 years ago?
There isn't a statute of
limitations on being a dick.
What'd you just say?
I said what I said.
You and me are
fighting right now.
Now, let's go!
Let's get it over with.
Oh, man, looks like our
friend's about to die.
Lenny, what's going on?
I'm calling the police!
We're already here.
Hold my hair, woman.
You ready for this?
Not at all,
but I'm gonna do this,
'cause I got to show
my son what's right.
We'd do anything for
our boys, wouldn't we?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
My boy's over in Afghanistan.
Well, you raised him right.
I hope he gets home safe soon.
Yeah, me, too.
Sucker-punch him, Feder.
Lick his bicep. Lick it,

Page 60/69

bite it, lick the tan off.
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.
Hit me right on the chin. I'll
go down like a sack of potatoes.
What are you talking about?
Just do it.
I know you'd do the same for
me if my boy was watching.
Let's get busy, Hollywood!
No! Don't hit me, please!
I'm sorry.
Please don't hit me.
You would tear
me limb from limb.
Open this.
The only reason I picked on you
was because I
was afraid of you.
What?
Oh, my God.
Please, please, please.
Just go with it.
I didn't think anyone would
believe you could knock me out.
Please. Don't hit me.
Cavanaugh's crying.
This is ridiculous!
Cavanaugh.
You mean you don't
want me to hit you with this?
No! Please.
Or the elbow?
Finger in the eye!
Wow.
Listen to this guy!
All right, get up.
Straighten up.
I'm not gonna hit you,
but if you ever disrespect me
or anybody,
I will hunt you down,
and I will slap you
into a pile of tattoos,

Page 61/69

bad breath
and back zits.
Oh, please.
Do you understand me?
Yes, I understand you.
Do you understand me?
Yes, I understand you!
Then walk away
before I change my mind.
Thank you very much.
Hey, man, look at him!
What just happened?
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!
Oh, my God, that was the
manliest thing you ever did.
You get extra special
hip-hop dance tonight.
Word up.
Hey, guys, if you see Leonard,
could you tell him that I'm
here waiting like we arranged?
Guys? Guys?
Yeah, okay.
Okay, I am a person!
That was awesome, by the way.
Had to. Had to.
Yeah, yeah, you had to.
He let you off the hook,
didn't he?
He did, he did,
but I had to go with it.
I can't believe it!
We hit the moron jackpot!
Everybody who needs a beating,
conveniently together on one lawn.
Who are they?
Brunson University frat guys.
Oh, God, I hate white people.
Excuse me, why are you here?
What's the matter?
I tell you what is the matter.
These old townies
trashed our frat house!
And nobody treats our good-times

Page 62/69

headquarters with disrespect!
Yeah!
They didn't do it.
Me do it.
Don't try and
cover for him, Z-Dog!
Who's Z-Dog?
We know they're
trying to get back at us
for making them do the naked
plunge in our swimming hole.
Your swimming hole?
I've been swimming
at the quarry since I
was eight years old.
Apparently,
everybody in this crap town
has been swimming there since
they were eight years old.
I guess nobody
wants to leave this dump
because they're
too busy sucking!
We'll finish later.
You promise?
I promise.
- Okay.
- Hey, smart guy!
Lenny Feder left this town,
moved to Hollywood,
made big bucks,
probably more money than
all you brainiacs put together
ever will.
But guess what?
He came back here.
'Cause this
beautiful town is his home.
And it always will be his home.
Well, that was just a moving
testament to this community, bro!
But we didn't come here
to hear any lame speeches.
We came here to kick

Page 63/69

some old, smelly ass!
Fellas, we may be old.
We may be smelly.
We may have a penis.
But the only ones getting
their ass kicked around here
is gonna be you spoiled,
privileged,
uppity, preppy D-bags.
You hear that?
Now, let's get busy!
They're
dancing on the ceiling
They're dancing on the floor
People everywhere
coming through the door
They know there's
a party going on
Come on, son!
You ain't tough!
Hit him!
Yeah, Braden!
Whoo! Yeah! Damn!
You want this?
Uh-oh!
Sir, please stop it!
That's not a sir!
That's a woman!
My woman!
Come on, babe.
I know you're
gonna lose control
You can do
Oh, you're so hot.
I know it's cold outside
Don't bust my face!
You saved me.
I will protect you for
the rest of your life.
Oh, okay, blow dryer boy.
Oh, God, no!
No! No!
Yeah! Yeah!
Having a good anniversary,

Page 64/69

babe?
Oh, honey, the best.
I can't breathe.
Choking me!
Yeah!
We did it. We did it, man.
Yeah.
We make a good team.
Yeah. Yeah, that was fun.
I know it's cold outside
Come on, babe,
I'll keep you satisfied
Boomer!
What's going on?
This!
You're a traitor, Boomer!
His name's not Boomer!
Oh!
It's Gary.
It's Greg.
Oh, Greg.
Oh, my God!
Did you see his head?
He's got a... He's bald!
I got a wild one!
I got a wild one!
Whoo hoo hoo!
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Nobody noogies my brother!
My brain! My brain!
Hey, man! I had that one.
I know you did, big brother.
Get out of here!
Don't hit me!
Hey, hey, look who showed up.
Flippy-boy. Yeah, you want to
flip your way out of this?
Too slow, old man.
Where you work out, Cinnabon?
Look who's back up, baby.
I didn't know we were kicking.
Give me a second to stretch.
All right.
We're gonna

Page 65/69

throw some legs, huh?
You want to
throw some legs, huh?
Boom!
That just happened.
What,
were you raised by ninjas?
Congratulations.
You won the fight.
Here's your prize.
Aw!
Thanks, little girl.
It looks just like you.
It's a monkey!
Look at me!
I'm a stupid little monkey.
Good night.
Come on, guys!
We got to get out!
Let's go!
Lenny! Baby.
Baby, are you all right?
I'm coming for you, Leonard!
I'm here for you, Leonard.
I'm here for you.
Who... Who are you?
It's your pretty, shiny Penny.
Oops, sorry,
I kicked your barrette.
Sorry, honey!
You guys were Fuji
and Tanaka out there.
This is just like high school.
Get drunk, get in a fight, wind up
back at Lamonsoff's, eating eggs.
Except for
the drunk part, Mommy.
Oh.
Oh, all you guys together
brings back so many memories.
Whoa, Dickie,
is this you and Lenny?
Let's see.
Yeah, me and Hollywood were

Page 66/69

best friends in kindergarten.
Yep.
What happened?
What do you mean, "What happened?"
We were in different classes.
We kind of
drifted apart, right?
Yeah. He was in
those smart classes.
I was in the other classes.
Hey, who's this guy?
- Anybody remember him?
- Who is that?
Wow, what happened to that kid?
He's still here.
Why do I know my new kid's gonna
end up looking like that?
You're having a baby, Lenny?
Yeah.
Yeah, so I'm told,
Mrs. Lamonsoff.
Oh, a surprise, huh?
Yes.
People today try to
plan things out so much.
But don't think an unexpected
child is loved any less
than one you planned for.
Someday, Lenny,
you won't even remember
what life was like
with just three children.
You think we wanted Eric?
He was an accident.
Mama.
His father and I were in the
men's room at a Patriots game...
You know what, I think I'm
just gonna turn the page here.
I'm turning the page.
Finish the story!
Officer Dante's
passed out on our lawn.
I know. I saw him

Page 67/69

trying to arrest an anthill.
Want to talk about
the whole pregnancy thing?
Mmm.
It's okay.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay, you go to sleep. I'll make
this between me and the baby.
Hello in there.
This is your daddy speaking.
I just want to tell you
welcome to the family,
and I love you very,
very, very much.
I really don't care if
you're a boy or girl.
I just need you to
promise me one thing.
When you're in elementary
school, study ballet,
so I can see that teacher
as much as possible.
Hey.
I knew that was coming.
To be honest, I don't need
no stinking ballet teacher.
I'm married to the most
beautiful woman in the world,
your mommy.
Are you saying
sweet things to me
because you want
to fool around?
That would be a nice way
to kick off the summer.
Okay, Mr. Romantic.
But let's do this quick,
we have a big
day tomorrow, okay?
Absolutely.
Watch your head in there.
Whoo!
Hang on.
Hang on. I'm sorry, honey.
Don't move. Don't move.
Oh, my God, I'm going to!
I did it! I burpsnarted! Yes!
Lenny, grow up!
I did it for the baby!
